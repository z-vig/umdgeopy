# Module 3: Practical Uses for Python Classes

---

## Intro/Background

A term that may come up quite a bit in Python stack exchanges and when discussing software/coding in general is the term Object-Oriented Programming (often abbreviated OOP). This term is vague and doesn't really describe the usefulness of the concept, so in this module we will be going over what OOP is and providing a couple of examples of where OOP might fit into your scientific workflow. We will also discuss a very useful default Python module called `dataclasses`, which is particularly helpful to scientists.

## Module Tasks

* [ ] Think of a scnetario in your own research where you might use a class to make things easier
* [ ] Write a useful `__init__()` function
* [ ] Write a method function
* [ ] Write a dataclass and be able to choose between this and a regular Python class
* [ ] Use class inheritance to generalize a class
* [ ] Use polymorphism to expand the capabilities of a class
* [ ] Use encapsulation to hide non-important details
