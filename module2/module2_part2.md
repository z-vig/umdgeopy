Module 2: Using Scientific Packages from the Internet :mag:
---
### *Part 2: Package Structure*

## Background
The term is thrown around quite a bit among python users. You might have heard early on in your python journey something along the lines of "oh, there's a python package for that!" Unfortunately, unless you have experience either making or using a python package, the term itselfis quite meaningless. In this module, we will go over exactly what a package is and how you, as a scientist, can get into using one right away for your needs, just by looking on the internet!

## Module Tasks
- [ ] Install `git`
- [ ] `clone` a "play package" from github
- [ ] Identify the modules/sub-modules associated with this package
- [ ] For each module/submodule identified, figure out what functions and classes are publicly available to use
- [ ] Select a package of your own on the internet and find its documentation (i.e. the docs)
- [ ] Select a function or class that may be useful to you, figure out its syntax and use away!

## Downloading Git
Since you are viewing this document, you already have experience with github. In order to complete this module, however, you must install `git` and perform a basic operation called `clone`. First, check if you already have `git` installed by running
```
git -v
```
in any terminal. If a response is printed, listing the version of your installation... success! You have `git` installed on your machine! Otherwise, go to the [git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install `git` for your OS. Choose the "standalone installer" to download the `git` installer executable. Run this file, selecting the default options and run the `git` version command shown above to ensure your installation worked.

NOTE: This is a particular scenario where, if you are using windows, you will need to know your processor type. (ARM or x64). If this is new to you, go to your settings>System>About menu and look for the "system type" entry. It should either say x64 (i.e. 64-bit, a.k.a. AMD) or ARM.
