## Module 1: Installing Python the Right Way
#### Background
Python is deceivingly simple to download. You can go [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version (3.13 as of May, 2025) or to [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and get an out-of-the-box python playground. However, especially for scientists, these download methods are not a great solution for longevity of your installation. When it comes time to update your python or install a package that needs a downgraded version of python, why would you stop your science to back to those websites and figure out what version of python you need, what folder it needs to be put into, how many packages need to be re-installed, etc... An ideal download method for scientists is one that requires the most minimal effort to maintain given the passing of time and the exploration of community-made packages. To achieve this goal, this module will walk through how to download python via a package manager, how to use this package manager to maintain and partition python environments for your different projects and, finally, how to share your python environments with scientists. If there is time, this module will finally go over what an IDE is and how it can incorporate the python environments you just created.
