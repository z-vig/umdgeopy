    "# `matplotlib` and `seaborn` Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting is one of the most important tasks of any scientific programming language and `matplotlib` is python's fulfilment of this fundamental task. `matplotlib` relies on a few different cross-platform GUI toolkits such as `Tk` and `Qt` (very descriptive, lol), which are powerful tools used across all languages to create visualizations. This makes `matplotlib` a somewhat universal plotting program while still being \"pythonic\" in the sense that it is intuitive and easy to use. One of the best features of `matplotlib`, however, is not in its technical versatility, but is its extreme popularity. Simple google \"matplotlib tutorial to do ______\" or something similar and an endless stream of content will pop up showing you exactly how to solve the problem you're trying to solve. The user base for `matplotlib` is endless and it is constantly being updated and supported by the development community. For this reason, the goal of this tutorial is not to teach you how to use `matplotlib`, because the internet has done this a million times over. Rather, the goal here is to give you some of the initial building blocks that will hopefully make you adept/curious enough to go look up tutorials for whatever specific task it is you are trying to do with visualizing your scientific results."

    "## Choosing a backend\n",
    "\n",
    "An important detail about `matplotlib` that is often over-looked in tutorials is choosing a backend. Backends are simply seperated pieces of coding logic that `matplotlib` uses to draw plots in different ways depending on your need. Right from the start, you should decide if you want your plot to be interactive or static and visit the [matplotlib website](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/backends.html) from there. In this notebook, a static backend is the automatic choice. Let's switch that to an interactive one for now."
