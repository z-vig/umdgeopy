An absolute file path starts from the base of your file system (on windows it is a drive letter like C:/... and on a mac, it just starts with your root ~/...). Which kind of path you choose to use is up to your particular use case."

    "The most painful thing about coding in file paths is when you all-of-a-sudden have to change operating systems and the way file paths are read changes. Luckily, `pathlib` accounts for this! There are two main types of OS file path types: Windows and POSIX. `pathlib` allows you to convert from a windows-like path to a posix-like path with the .as_posix() method. When creating a Path object, it will automatically detect your operating system and ensure that the path matches the file path style that is compatible."
