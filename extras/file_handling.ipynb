    "#### Relative vs. Absolute File Paths\n",
    "An important distinction when coding using file paths is to determine whether you should be using relative or absolute file paths. An absolute file path starts from the base of your file system (on windows it is a drive letter like C:/... and on a mac, it just starts with your root ~/...). Which kind of path you choose to use is up to your particular use case."

    "\n",
    "The most painful thing about coding in file paths is when you all-of-a-sudden have to change operating systems and the way file paths are read changes. Luckily, `pathlib` accounts for this! There are two main types of OS file path types: Windows and POSIX. `pathlib` allows you to convert from a windows-like path to a posix-like path with the .as_posix() method. When creating a Path object, it will automatically detect your operating system and ensure that the path matches the file path style that is compatible."
